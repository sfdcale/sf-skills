## Quick Start

### Basic Usage

```
"Create a screen flow to collect customer feedback and save it to a custom object"

"Create a record-triggered flow on Opportunity that updates related contacts when stage changes"

"Create an autolaunched flow that takes an account ID and returns the total opportunity value"
```

### Flow Types

**Screen Flow**
```
User: "Create a screen flow for account creation"

The skill will:
1. Ask for flow details (name, description, target org)
2. Generate interactive screens with form fields
3. Validate the flow structure
4. Deploy with two-step process
5. Provide testing checklist
```

**Record-Triggered Flow**
```
User: "Create a record-triggered flow on Account after save"

The skill will:
1. Ask for trigger object and conditions
2. Generate bulkified flow with <bulkSupport>true</bulkSupport>
3. Validate no DML in loops (CRITICAL check)
4. Add fault paths to DML operations
5. Deploy and provide bulk testing guidance
```

**Autolaunched Flow**
```
User: "Create an autolaunched flow with input/output variables"

The skill will:
1. Design input/output variables
2. Create reusable logic
3. Validate naming conventions
4. Deploy with testing recommendations
```

**Scheduled Flow**
```
User: "Create a scheduled flow to run nightly at 2am"

The skill will:
1. Set up schedule configuration
2. Create bulkified batch processing logic
3. Ensure DML is outside loops (best practice)
4. Deploy and provide monitoring guidance
```

## Validation Features

### Comprehensive Checks

**CRITICAL ERRORS** (Block deployment immediately):
- ❌ DML operations inside loops (causes bulk failures)
- ❌ Broken element references
- ❌ Missing required elements
- ❌ Invalid XML structure

**WARNINGS** (Block in strict mode):
- ⚠️  Missing <bulkSupport>true</bulkSupport> on record-triggered flows
- ⚠️  DML operations without fault paths
- ⚠️  Unused variables
- ⚠️  Loops that should use Transform element
- ⚠️  Naming convention violations

**BEST PRACTICES**:
- ✓ API version 62.0 (latest)
- ✓ Descriptive element names
- ✓ Flow description present
- ✓ Transform used for field mapping

### Enhanced Scoring System (6 Categories)

Flows are scored 0-110 across 6 best practice categories:
- **Design & Naming** (20 pts) - Naming conventions, documentation, element naming
- **Logic & Structure** (20 pts) - Decision complexity, Transform usage, DML in loops check
- **Architecture & Orchestration** (15 pts) - Modularity, subflow usage, reusability
- **Performance & Bulk Safety** (20 pts) - Bulkification, SOQL/DML counts, governor limits
- **Error Handling & Observability** (20 pts) - Fault paths, error logging, monitoring
- **Security & Governance** (15 pts) - Running mode, sensitive fields, API version

**Rating Scale:**
- ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Excellent (95-110 pts / 95%+)
- ⭐⭐⭐⭐ Very Good (85-94 pts / 85-94%)
- ⭐⭐⭐ Good (75-84 pts / 75-84%)
- ⭐⭐ Fair (60-74 pts / 60-74%)
- ⭐ Needs Improvement (<60 pts / <60%)

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

💡 Recommendations for Improvement:
1. [Error Handling] Add Sub_LogError for structured error logging
2. [Architecture] Consider breaking into parent + subflows for complex logic
3. [Documentation] Expand flow description for better documentation
```

## Two-Step Deployment

The skill always uses a safe deployment process:

**Step 1: Validation (Check-Only)**
```
- Deploys with --check-only flag (dry-run)
- Verifies metadata structure
- Checks org-specific compatibility
- No actual deployment yet
```

**Step 2: Actual Deployment**
```
- Only proceeds if validation passes
- Deploys to target org
- Monitors deployment status
- Provides verification steps
```

**Step 3: Activation Prompt**
```
Always asks before activating:
- "Keep as Draft" (recommended for production)
- "Activate Now" (use after thorough testing)
```

## Best Practices Enforced

### Performance
- **Bulkification**: All record-triggered flows must handle collections
- **No DML in Loops**: CRITICAL ERROR if detected
- **Transform Element**: 30-50% faster than loops for field mapping
- **Minimize DML**: Batch operations where possible

### Design
- **Error Handling**: Fault paths on all DML operations
- **Meaningful Names**: Variables (camelCase), Elements (PascalCase_With_Underscores)
- **Descriptions**: Document complex logic
- **Subflows**: Reusable patterns

### Security
- **System vs User Mode**: Understand implications
- **Field-Level Security**: Validate permissions
- **No Hardcoded Data**: Use variables or custom settings

## Requirements

- **Salesforce CLI**: `sf` command installed and configured
- **sf-deployment skill**: Version ≥2.0.0 (for deployment operations)
- **Python 3**: For validation script (optional but recommended)
- **Target Org**: Authenticated org with appropriate permissions

## Testing Your Flows

### Screen Flows
- Navigate to Setup → Flows → [FlowName]
- Click "Run" to test UI
- Verify all screens and decision paths
- Test with invalid data for validation

### Record-Triggered Flows
- Create test records that meet trigger criteria
- **CRITICAL**: Test with bulk data (200+ records)
- Check Debug Logs for execution
- Verify no governor limit errors

### Autolaunched Flows
- Create Apex test classes to invoke
- Test with various input parameters
- Verify output variables
- Check error handling

### Scheduled Flows
- Test logic manually before activating schedule
- Monitor first scheduled run
- Verify batch processing with expected volume

## Troubleshooting

### "Validation fails but I can't see the issue"
Run the comprehensive validator directly:
```bash
python3 ~/.claude/skills/sf-flow-builder/validators/enhanced_validator.py \
  force-app/main/default/flows/YourFlow.flow-meta.xml
```

### "Flow works in sandbox but fails in production"
- Check field-level security differences
- Verify all dependent metadata deployed
- Review validation rules
- Test with production data volume

### "Performance issues with flow"
- Check for DML in loops (validator catches this)
- Use Transform element instead of loops
- Minimize DML operations
- Use Get Records with filters

### "Flow doesn't appear after deployment"
- Check deployment status: `sf project deploy report`
- Verify user permissions
- Refresh metadata in org
