## 💡 What is a Skill?

> **Skills are portable knowledge packs that supercharge AI coding agents with domain expertise.**

Think of skills as "installable superpowers" for your agentic coding tool. Instead of repeatedly explaining Salesforce best practices to your AI assistant, a skill pre-loads that knowledge so the AI becomes an instant expert.

| | Component | Description |
|:-:|-----------|-------------|
| 📋 | **Prompt Template** | Domain-specific instructions & best practices the AI follows |
| 📁 | **Code Templates** | Ready-to-use patterns, snippets, and boilerplate for common tasks |
| ✅ | **Validation Hooks** | Auto-checks that run when you write files (scoring, linting) |
| 🔗 | **Tool Integrations** | CLI commands, APIs, and external tools the skill can invoke |

### Why Use Skills?

| Without Skills | With Skills |
|----------------|-------------|
| ❌ Explain best practices every conversation | ✅ AI already knows the standards |
| ❌ Manually review code for anti-patterns | ✅ Auto-validation on every file save |
| ❌ Copy-paste boilerplate repeatedly | ✅ Production-ready templates built-in |
| ❌ Remember CLI commands and flags | ✅ Skill handles tool orchestration |
| ❌ Burn tokens on lengthy system prompts | ✅ Skills load on-demand, saving context |

## ✨ Available Skills

| Skill | Description | Status |
|-------|-------------|--------|
| **[sf-apex](sf-apex/)** | Apex code generation & review with 150-point scoring | ✅ Live |
| **[sf-flow-builder](sf-flow-builder/)** | Flow creation & validation with 110-point scoring | ✅ Live |
| **[sf-deployment](sf-deployment/)** | DevOps & CI/CD automation using sf CLI v2 | ✅ Live |

## 🚀 Installation

First, add the marketplace to Claude Code:

```bash
/plugin marketplace add Jaganpro/sf-skills
```

Then install only the skills you need:

```bash
# Flow development
/plugin install sf-flow-builder@sf-skills-marketplace

# Apex development
/plugin install sf-apex@sf-skills-marketplace

# Deployment automation
/plugin install sf-deployment@sf-skills-marketplace

# Skill creation wizard
/plugin install skill-builder@sf-skills-marketplace
```

### Local Development Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Jaganpro/sf-skills.git
cd sf-skills

# Install all skills
/plugin install .

# Or add as local marketplace, then install individually
/plugin marketplace add .
/plugin install sf-flow-builder@sf-skills-marketplace
```

## 🔗 Skill Dependencies

Some skills work together for a complete workflow:

```
┌─────────────────┐     ┌─────────────────┐
│  sf-flow-builder │────▶│  sf-deployment  │
└─────────────────┘     └─────────────────┘
                              ▲
┌─────────────────┐           │
│     sf-apex     │───────────┘
└─────────────────┘
```

- **sf-flow-builder** and **sf-apex** optionally use **sf-deployment** for deploying to Salesforce orgs
- Each skill works standalone, but will prompt you to install dependencies if needed

## 🔌 Plugin Features

### Automatic Validation Hooks

Each skill includes validation hooks that run automatically when you write files:

| Skill | File Type | Validation |
|-------|-----------|------------|
| sf-flow-builder | `*.flow-meta.xml` | Flow best practices, 110-point scoring, bulk safety |
| sf-apex | `*.cls`, `*.trigger` | Apex anti-patterns, 150-point scoring, TAF compliance |
| skill-builder | `SKILL.md` | YAML frontmatter validation |

Hooks provide **advisory feedback** after writes - they inform but don't block.

### Validation Scoring

**Flow Validation (110 points)**:
- Design & Naming (20 pts)
- Logic & Structure (20 pts)
- Architecture (15 pts)
- Performance & Bulk Safety (20 pts)
- Error Handling (20 pts)
- Security (15 pts)

**Apex Validation (150 points)**:
- Bulkification (25 pts)
- Security (25 pts)
- Testing (25 pts)
- Architecture (20 pts)
- Clean Code (20 pts)
- Error Handling (15 pts)
- Performance (10 pts)
- Documentation (10 pts)

## 🔧 Prerequisites

- **Claude Code** (latest version)
- **Salesforce CLI** v2.x (`sf` command, not legacy `sfdx`)
- **Python 3.8+** (optional, for validation hooks)
